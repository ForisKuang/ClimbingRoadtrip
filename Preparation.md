# Preparation

## Motivation

I had been thinking of doing a climbing roadtrip for quite sometime throughout my undergraduate career,however due to a lack of an SUV or car for that matter, unfortunately I was never able to realize this dream.

Having graduated however, with a job lined up, the window of opportunity to make this dream come true had opened. First, thank the Lord, that the job I am to be working at post-graduate had a hefty sign-on bonus that they were able to give me which meant that I could fund this trip and others that came prior and that were to come in the future.

When I first started thinking of making this trip into reality, it was a lofty idea with no clear cut itinerary, just a simple roadtrip from Phoenix, AZ to Squamish, B.C., Canada, with pitstops along the way to climb and see friends. The seeing friends, actually is quite necessary because I am quite a lonely person, so any social interaction is nice. Ideally I would have wanted to do this with other person, but to ask or find someone who lives in Arizona and resides in Washington, that climbs and is willing to partake in this endeavor is abysmally small. Thus, this trip became a solo one.

## Getting a Car
The first and most pressing order of business was to get a car that could one support this trip and furthermore, live up to my lifestyle. Something that could truly hold up to the multifarious terrains I would be traversing on this roadtrip but also would be inevitably encountering in the Pacific Northwest (PNW). This led to very obvious type of car that I would be seeking, a large, AWD or 4WD, SUV.

Why an SUV and not a truck? The answer is not actually gas mileage, anything that is AWD/4WD will have just as horrible gas mileage as say a Toyota Tacoma, but becuse it is more emblematic of a PNW vibe and not as daunting. Call me a bandwagonner if you must, but hey, I like the appeal.

With the type of in mind, I started casually perusing Craigslist and CarGurus for cars that satisfied these requirements. I mention casually, because the timeline for this was when I was still in school and I wouldn't be setting out for this roadtrip for another 2-3 months. Furthermore, I wouldn't even be home in Phoenix to look at these cars until around 2 months out. It was more to see what the market looked like, what was a good price, what was a good vehicle, and more.

I have to thank my father quite a bit for without his constant perusing of CarGurus and going to auctions I would not nearly have as good of an understanding of the car market and what to look for. He had also been trying out cars for me that we both considered interesting or potentially good buys, however, even if they were good, they would either get snatched up because I was so far out from actually buying or outside of my budget. As a new grad, my budget was pretty low.

Fast forward 2 months, I'm back from my travels abroad, as many privileged new grads do, and finally in Phoenix where I can actually try out cars. My dad has been talking to local dealers and had a number of cars in mind, but we both agreed that the Subaru Forester was probably the best bet for my needs. A truly PNW car, with more than enough space to sleep in it. I specifically wanted a car large enough to sleep in because a lot of the times when I go on camping trips, it is in the winter or spring, which surprisingly gets cold, so sleeping in a tent is torture, unless you have a sleeping bag that is rated for that temperature, but even still your face feels like it's being bitten by the cold, truly nippy.

So my dad and I set out to try out these Foresters, but we would be open to other cars should they meet the requirements or potentially surpass them. My dad and I venture to a local dealership, a father and son dealership, with as my dad called them "honest men making an honest living." My dad very rarely says this so I was excited to go hear, as corporate dealerships always mark up or have so many hidden fees. So we arrive at J & E Auto Sales and they have a Forester that is ready to be test driven, however, there is a pretty substantial problem. It's manual. I can drive manual, but I'm not at that second nature level of driving a manual, so I'm worried about doing a roadtrip in this as well as, if someone needed to drive my car and doesn't know manual, they wouldn't be able to. As such, I didn't end up trying out this car. Instead they recommended me to this 2013 Lexus RX350, so I gave that a test drive. That car was phenomenal and not a great car to start on because it would make every other car I drove seem to just not match up. It was smooth, powerful, had an amazing sound setup (something vital for long roadtrips), a sun roof, and the most unneccessary features, such as memorizing your seat arrangement, heating and COOLING seats, and etc. After that test drive, I didn't realize that I would become enamored with this car, however the price tag was a hefty 15.4k.

This was way over budget so it was very much a pipe dream if I were to get this car. I tried out other cars they had, a 2010 Porsche Cayenne, which for such a high end car, was very mediocre. It didn't drive smooth, the sound system was good, mileage was bad, but most importantly, I wouldn't feel safe driving this on a roadtrip for fear of being broken into and my own personal safety. Not only this, this fear would extend into even living in Seattle, as I know a number of people who get their car broken into, a friend just recently so. Therefore I wasn't about to set myself up for defeat. The next car I tried at this dealership was a 2007 Toyota 4Runner with very high mileage, but it was 4WD and had tires that could take on anything. If I drove this car, safety would be a foregone conclusion. This isn't the type of car people break into, it's the type of car people beware of, because chances are the person who drives this car probably will kick your ass. Also, this car would be able to handle anything I could throw at it. Snow, done. Off-Road, easy-peasy. SF Hills? This car eats that for breakfast to get it's gains. Driving this made me feel like I owned the road. The windows allowed you to see everything. There was no blindspot. Furthermore, it was powerful, had this massive sunroof, came installed with A/T tires, so I wouldn't need to spend that much money on new tires and had all the extra features you would expect of a 4WD. 2WD, differential axle control, etc. I loved this car. More so than the Lexus. The only problem, this car had approximately 250k miles. That thing wouldn't be alive much longer. So, that car was not an option.

Sadly this first dealership exploring and trying out was uneventful, or so I thought. My dad was drawn in so much by the allure of the Lexus, he decided to go for it. He "was going to negotiate it down" to hopefully around 13k, a little beyond my budget, but for this car, I'd be willing to go a little out of budget. And, if I didn't get this car, he would. So he talked the men down to 14.2k which is pretty substantial and we signed a contract saying that we would be purchasing it the following day.

I don't want to bore you with all the other dealers we went to, but here is the TLDR. We went to 3 more dealerships to try out Foresters only to realize, it drove, to be frank, uncomfortably. I wouldn't want to spend hours driving in this car and probably neither would you. Thus, I would be buying this beautiful 2013 Lexus RX350.

## Buying stuff

There are a number of items that are necessary, from food to climbing gear, and of course camping/car camping gear. To begin, lets start with camping and roadtrip equipment.

### Roadtrip Equipment

The number one item that you are going to need for car camping is obviously a sleeping bag. But a sleeping bag alone is not going to provide adequate and comfortable sleep, thus I had, from pervious camping trips, a sleeping pad. This is honestly a life saver. Even though it only adds a couple of inches off the ground, that keeps you warm and acts essentially as a mattress.

The next item that I thought would be necessary is a 7 gallon water tank. You can pick up these from REI, Walmart, or any general store that has an outdoor section. My thought process behind this is that I'm not entirely sure how often I am going to be able to get fresh filtered and or tap water, so when I would come across a place that had tap water I would refill the tank. Also this water would also allow me to get a rag and take a dirtbag shower. Also this water tank would be able to last me for about a week if rationed well, which is more than enough and sfficient for worst case scenario.

The other item that I found very useful is a crank light, that is one of those lights that don't need batteries. This became useful when i realized that at night I don't want to be using the car battery to keep the car lights on, so using the crank light provided lighting without using any electricity!

Next is a DC Output to 200W Inverter with AC outlets and usb charging. This inverter is wonderful because it allows me to charge not only my laptop, but other equipement while charging my phone. Furthermore, it runs off the engine, make sure you don't try and power this off the battery or you will drain your battery. This was all for a nice price of 25 dollars.

Next was the classic no rinse shampoo and the dude wipes/sea to summit bathing wipes. Because I will be without a place to truly shower, it's nice to have something that will keep me sanitary to some degree.

Finally, the most important thing, as this is a climbing trip is all my climbing stuff. 2 Crashpads, my sport rack and etc.

I had the idea of adding a GPS located dash camp so that my parents could know where I am, however, I forgot to attach it to the car. I do think this is a great ease of mind item, that and some sort of weapon.

## FOOD

Honestly all I did was go to Costco and buy food.
